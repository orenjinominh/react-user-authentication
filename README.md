# React Authentication for Front End Masters

## Protecting Routes Challenges

* Make an authenticated `GET` request to the `/instructors` endpoint and display the returned resources in the **Instructors** view
* Make an authenticated `POST` request to the `/instructors` endpoint to create a new instructor and return to the **Instructors** route to display the newly created resource

## Running the App

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the app:

```bash
npm start
```

The app will be served at `localhost:3000`.
